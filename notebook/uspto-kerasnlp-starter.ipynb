These queries, which effectively characterize groups of patents, are well known to patent professionals. Specifically, we need to create a model that will generate binary search queries from a patent and its neighbor $50$ patents, which will return the same set of $50$ neighbor patents when searched in the USPTO database. The problem in this competition can be visually described as below:\n","\n","<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/q7jYCHLY/USPTO-problem.png\" width=\"550\"></div>\n","\n","In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to approach this problem with an iterative comparison method to extract effective queries.
